Hang around the pool to enjoy the chill and fun. Read a book, share a photo, chat with friends, or watch the video clips. Yes, you definitely need the WiFi to make that happen. 

Providing WiFi services in the pool area is easy. An EAP225-Outdoor access point can provide a reliable signal around the pool. The outdoor EAP is IP67 waterproof  rating which is ready for outdoor use.

It also comes with the mesh feature, if you want to extend the service area, just power on the second EAP225-Outdoor. The mesh network manager will handle everything else.
